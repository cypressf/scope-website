                        <p>In cases when users don’t have prevalent internet, there usually physical hotspots which provide internet data. For example, many Indian markets are flooded with shops which provide usb sticks full of movies and music for people to purchase. Some of them even have subscriptions models so that people without internet can stay upto date with the new content that is being posted. And media is not the only commodity being exchanged. This idea stemmed from sharing pirated software which is still a readily practiced activity. Users can go to these physical hotspot shops and download latest android or iPhone apps as they desire. Tie-ups with such hotspots or self creation of them can enable incentivizing to go back for updates.

                        <p>Once the app is on their phone, how can one interact with the internet dependent facebook. Our demo shows such a possibility. The major assumption, as it always is with our peer to peer facebook, is that in the physical vicinity of the user there lies one or more users with a stable internet connection. So, a user which offline facebook can simply use the other phone as a router to get it’s newsfeed. Although not show in our demo application, uploads to facebook can also be routed through that phone. 

                        </p>

                    </ul>

                        <li class="text"><h3 class="nocaps"><a href="#q_offline_fb"> Effect on the overall network with many offline nodes</a></h3> </li>

                        <p>Routing through people with internet, one can see an unbiased increased in their mobile data usage. There can be two possible solutions to this; the first is that the user gets to choose whether they wish to allow routing via p2p connections, and the second that the app only allows it if there is phone through with the client is routing is connected to wifi. This is not so far fetched since 10% of all internet users in India have wifi access points on a daily basis. 
                        <br />
                        The key to success for the proposed offline facebook model would be internet availability in physical vicinity. We can twist this requirement to say if and when the phone is in vicinity of another, there should posts which are shared over automatically.This would be the first step to make an offline facebook seamless. To make sure that posts always exist when an offline user opens the application, a local cache needs to present in an updated state. An idea would be to implement predictive behavior for the router phones to see when and if they are in the vicinity of the clients. Example,  if phone A is in the vicinity of phone B every day from 3-5 pm then when phone A has internet, it should cache phone B’s newsfeed so that at 3 pm phone B’s cache can be replenished.
